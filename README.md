# what it does

AdmitWise takes a holistic approach to the university admissions process, employing data driven comprehensive analysis of various factors related to each applicant. These factors include the applicant's Statement of Purpose (SOP), Letters of Recommendation (LOR), GRE scores, GPA (Grade Point Average), achievements, and extracurricular activities. The system evaluates the quality and alignment of the SOP, the strength of LORs, the significance of GRE scores as an academic indicator, the applicant's academic performance through GPA, their achievements and awards, and their participation in extracurricular activities. AdmitWise utilizes sophisticated algorithms and AI-driven analysis to process and weigh these factors, providing admissions committees with a more data-driven and comprehensive assessment of each candidate's application. This, in turn, will allow our university to make better-informed decisions about whether to admit a candidate, reject their application, or place them on a waitlist. AdmitWise serves as a valuable data assistant, enhancing the admissions process and ensuring that universities select the most promising and suitable candidates for their programs.

# How we built it

AdmitWise has been designed with the goal of improving university admissions. It uses a user-friendly interface created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which makes it easy for universities, admission committees, and applicants to interact. This modern approach simplifies and streamlines the admissions process.

AdmitWise stores and manages all the data in MongoDB, a versatile database system. This allows for the efficient organization of information related to university applications, including applicant profiles and documents. It ensures that data is well-organized and easily accessible.

AdmitWise uses Python and NLP tools to analyze applicant data and make data-driven decisions. It collects data from different sources, like applicant submissions and recommendation letters, stores it in MongoDB, and then uses Python to clean and organize the data. NLP tools help extract insights from unstructured text, like statements of purpose. The results of this analysis provide valuable recommendations to admission committees, helping them make informed decisions about which candidates are the best fit for their programs. AdmitWise acts as a helpful tool, making the admissions process more efficient and data-driven.
